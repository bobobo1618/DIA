This is a basic image server I've written for hosting my own images and a ton of wallpapers. Be nice. It's nothing like ready for public use yet but I figured I'd put it here anyway.

Basically, you use a (very) basic (but working) interface to shove images in a Riak database. They can then be viewed pretty easily.
